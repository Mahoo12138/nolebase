We tell our kids it doesn't matter if you win or lose, but let's be honest, winning feels pretty great. There's nothing like that golden moment in the sun. I think every parent probably wants that for their child, and maybe a little bit for ourselves too. Sometimes we push too hard, and that leads to a lot of resentment and guilty. **So how much is so much?** Here's where I come out, guilt fades, hardware is forever.
	
我们教育孩子说，输赢无所谓，但平心而论，胜利的感觉好极了，他们在阳光下的那一刻是无与伦比的美丽。也许每位家长都希望孩子能有这样的时刻，甚至希望自己也能这样。有时我们太苛求结果，结果导致许多怨恨和愧疚。**怎么才算不过分呢**？我的想法是，愧疚总会过去，奖牌才是硬道理的😄。

We talk a lot about tradition this time of year. But as much as we love our traditions, sometimes our best memories come from the times that are the most untraditional. We remember the year Mom and Dad went crazy. We remember the years Santa punched out the caroler. But for me, this was the year that the word “Tradition” … got a lot bigger. 
	
每年的这个时候，我们就会经常谈论传统。尽管我们深爱着自己的传统，但有时候我们最美好的会回忆，却是来自最颠覆传统的时刻。我们记得爸妈发狂的那一年。我们记得圣诞老人打了颂歌者的那一年。但对我来说，今年是让“传统”这个词变得更有意义的一年。
