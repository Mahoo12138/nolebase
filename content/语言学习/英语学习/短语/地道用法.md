## 俚语

>My best friend is going to die a virgin.  *我最好的朋友注定要当一辈子处女了*

To die without ever having had sex. For people who chose to die a virgin it's fine. But for people who didn't, it is a sign if failure. To die a virgin without choosing to means that you were never loved by anyone outside if your family.

die 是动词，谓语；virgin 是名词（处男，处女，圣母），这里的名词作伴随状语，表状态，**伴随状语表达的动作或状态是伴随句子谓语动词的动作而发生或存在的**，其实可以把句子看作是 die as a virgin，不过显得画蛇添足，不够地道，但是方便理解。

>  Get off your high horse. *别在这装清高了*

 "Get off your high horse" is an idiom people retort with in an argument when the other person is acting like a holier-than-thou being when in reality, they aren't. To put it in a simpler manner, to tell people to stop acting as if they're the top authority when they aren't.
